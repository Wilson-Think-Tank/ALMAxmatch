    "This notebook will walk you through using the ALMA archive query enhanced for identifying spectral lines potentially observed. It works through an example looking for observations from a circular region of radius 6&deg; centered on the Virgo Cluster in a redshift range of $0.005 \\leq z \\leq 0.1$ which may contain CO (J=2-1) and CN (N=1-0). The `archiveSearch.runTargetQueryWithLines` convenience function does most of the work so the remainder of the notebook explores the results tables and checks for projects and sources that may have had both lines observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying approach wrapped up in the `archiveSearch.runTargetQueryWithLines` function is to \n",
    "1. calculate the frequency range that contains our lines, in the given redshift range\n",
    "1. query the ALMA archive region using that frequency range\n",
    "1. match the source names in the ALMA archive against names in the NED database\n",
    "1. use the redshift from NED to calculate the observed frequency of our lines for each source\n",
    "1. check if the ALMA spectral window coverage contains the observed line frequencies"
